        How the ECF supports induction
      </h1>

      <p>The ECF is a framework for the professional development of early career teachers (ECTs). ECF-based training is part of their 2-year inductions, but is not assessed.

      <p>The ECF is designed to help ECTs succeed at the start of their teaching careers.</p>

      <p>The framework sets out what all ECTs should learn about, and learn how to do, including:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>setting high expectations </li>
        <li>promoting good progress </li>
        <li>demonstrating good subject and curriculum knowledge </li>
        <li>planning and teaching well-structured lessons </li>
        <li>adapting teaching </li>
        <li>making accurate and productive use of assessment </li>
        <li>managing behaviour effectively </li>
        <li>fulfilling wider professional responsibilities </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The training ECTs receive as part of their 2-year induction should be based on this framework. It’s known as ‘ECF-based training’. </p>

      <p>You can find the full description of the framework in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">ECF policy paper</a>.</p>

      <p>The ECF and the evidence for the framework have been independently assessed and endorsed by the <a href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk">Education Endowment Foundation (EEF)</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">ECF-based training is part of induction</h2>

      <p>ECTs serving a 2-year induction are entitled to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a 2-year programme of ECF-based training</li>
        <li>support from a dedicated mentor</li>
        <li>time off timetable for induction activities, including ECF-based training and mentor</li> sessions
        <li>regular progress reviews and 2 formal assessments against the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">Teachers’ Standards</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Schools can offer their ECTs extra training and support in addition to ECF-based training, but not instead of ECF-based training.</p>

      <p>Read an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/changes-to-statutory-induction-for-early-career-teachers-ects">overview of the 2-year ECT induction</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">ECF-based training is not an assessment tool</h2>

      <p>ECF-based training is separate from the formal assessment of an ECT’s performance against the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">Teachers’ Standards</a>.</p>

      <p>ECTs must not be assessed:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>against the knowledge, skills and working habits described in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">ECF policy paper</a></li>
        <li>on the activities or assignments from their ECF-based training</li>
      </ul>

      <p> ECTs can use documentation from ECF-based training to help prove they have met the teachers’ standards, but they:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>cannot fail any part of their ECF-based training</li>
        <li>do not need to fully complete their ECF-based training to pass induction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can read more about how to assess ECTs in section 2 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england">statutory guidance on ECT induction</a>.</p>
